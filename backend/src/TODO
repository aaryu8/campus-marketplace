        1. Redis session store (currently uses default MemoryStore — not for production)
        2. Session expiration on inactivity (optional: rolling sessions)
        3. Rate limiting / brute-force protection on login
        4. Email verification / OTP (you mentioned TODO)
        5. More structured error handling (try/catch on all async routes)
